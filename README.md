# 2018-Kaggle-ML-DS-Survey-Challenge

Kaggle is launching the first Data Science Survey Challenge, where we will be awarding a prize pool of $28,000 to kernel authors who tell a rich story about a subset of the data science and machine learning community.

The challenge objective: tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!

# My Approach

A refereshingly different approach has been used in my work by using a dialogues between two colleagues to tell the whole story.
